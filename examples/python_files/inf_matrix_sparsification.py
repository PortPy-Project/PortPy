"""
The dose influence matrix is a fundamental component in the optimization process, but its handling can introduce
computational challenges. The original matrix, being dense, requires substantial computational resources to manage.
Hence, PortPy, by default, loads a truncated version of the matrix.
For more accurate dose calculations or customized sparsification, users have the option to load the dense influence matrix.
This example will guide you through the following processes:

1. Generating a plan utilizing the default sparse matrix
2. Loading the full and dense influence matrix for improved dose calculation accuracy
3. Manually sparsifying the full influence matrix

    3) Manually sparsifying the full influence matrix

The sparse and full matrices are both pre-computed and included in the PortPy data. The sparse matrix was obtained by 
setting the small elements, i.e., those less than a certain threshold specified in 'my_plan.inf_matrix.sparse_tol', 
in the full matrix to zero. 
This threshold was calculated as 1% of the maximum value of the influence matrix for the planner's beams.

For demonstration purposes, we will manually generate the sparse matrix from the full matrix using the threshold specified by 'my_plan.inf_matrix.sparse_tol'. Note that users have the flexibility to sparsify the full matrix using any arbitrary threshold that suits their requirements.
