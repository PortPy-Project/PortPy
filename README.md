# What is PortPy?

PortPy, short for **P**lanning and **O**ptimization for **R**adiation **T**herapy, 
is an initiative aimed at creating an open-source Python library for 
cancer radiotherapy treatment planning optimization. 
This project encompasses planning methodologies for Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT), 
Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT), and other emerging modalities. 
PortPy offers clinical-grade benchmark datasets and coding resources to promote *benchmarking*, 
*reproducibility*, and *community development*.

# Benchmark data, benchmark algorithms, and PortPy toolkit <a name="benchmark"></a>

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/AI_Pyramid.png" width="40%" height="40%">
<p>

The figure above illustrates the inspiration behind developing PortPy, drawing from successful 
open-source practices in the AI and computer science communities. Tools like PyTorch and TensorFlow, 
along with benchmark datasets such as ImageNet and algorithms like AlexNet, have revolutionized AI 
and data science. Our goal is to replicate this success by providing researchers with a benchmark 
dataset (currently featuring 50 curated lung patients), benchmark algorithms for finding globally 
optimal plans using Mixed Integer Programming, and the PortPy toolkit for 
creating, evaluating, and visualizing treatment plans.




# What can you do with PortPy? <a name="WhatDo"></a>

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/PortPy-Workflow.png" width="90%" height="40%">
<p>

PortPy facilitates the **design**, **testing**, and **clinical validation** of new treatment planning algorithms. 
This includes both cutting-edge AI-based models and traditional optimization techniques. 
The above figure illustrates the PortPy design and its three main
modules: “Data Management”, “Plan Generation”, and “Plan
Evaluation”,  which are discussed below. We recommend reviewing our Jupyter Notebooks 
[examples](#QuickStart) for a more comprehensive understanding of these modules. 

1. **Data Management**
     * This module provides access to the curated benchmark PortPy dataset, allowing 
   researchers to test their algorithms on a standardized dataset (see [basic_tutorial.ipynb](https://github.com/PortPy-Project/PortPy/blob/master/examples/1_basic_tutorial.ipynb) notebook)
     * The available data includes: 
        1) CT images and contours 
        2) all necessary data for optimization extracted from Eclipse using its API (version 16.1) 
        3) expert-selected beams for each patient 
        4) an IMRT plan for each patient, 
generated using our in-house automated planning system, 
ECHO ([YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/895M6j5KjPs), [Paper](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/mp.13572)).
More information about data can be found in [Data](#Data) section.
     * In the current version, you can only work with the benchmark dataset provided in this PortPy repo and 
   cannot use your own dataset for now. We will address this problem in the near future

2. **Plan Generation**
     * This module facilitates the generation of treatment plans using either classical optimization methods or 
emerging AI-based techniques 
     * For optimization tasks, PortPy has been integrated with [CVXPy](https://www.cvxpy.org/), a widely-used open-source package. 
CVXPy enables the high-level formulation of optimization problems and offers out-of-the-box access to a range
of free (e.g., [SCIP](https://www.scipopt.org/), [SCIPY](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html)) and commercial (e.g., [MOSEK](https://www.mosek.com/), [CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio/cplex-optimizer), [GUROBI](https://www.gurobi.com/)) optimization engines (available for free for research
purposes) (see [basic_tutorial.ipynb](https://github.com/PortPy-Project/PortPy/blob/master/examples/1_basic_tutorial.ipynb) notebook)
     * PortPy.AI module is equipped with essential functionalities for AI-based planning. These include data access, 
data pre-processing, model training and testing, and patient-specific 3D dose prediction 
(see [imrt_dose_prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/PortPy-Project/PortPy/blob/master/examples/imrt_dose_prediction.ipynb) notebook)

3. **Plan Visualization and Evaluation**
     * Basic built-in visualization tools (e.g., DVH, dose distribution) are integrated into PortPy 
     * Enhanced visualizations are available through the integration with the popular open-source [3DSlicer](https://www.slicer.org/) package (see [3d_slicer_integration.ipynb](https://github.com/PortPy-Project/PortPy/blob/master/examples/3d_slicer_integration.ipynb) notebook)
     * Plans can be quantitatively evaluated using well-established clinical protocols (e.g., Lung 2Gyx30, see  [basic_tutorial.ipynb](https://github.com/PortPy-Project/PortPy/blob/master/examples/1_basic_tutorial.ipynb))
     * Plans can be imported into any TPS for final clinical evaluations  (see [imrt_tps_import.ipynb](https://github.com/PortPy-Project/PortPy/blob/master/examples/imrt_tps_import.ipynb))  


# How to contribute? <a name="HowContribute"></a>
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/PortPy_Organization.png" width="90%" height="40%">
<p>

As illustrated in the above figure, PortPy organization includes "PortPy", which is the current repository, 
and PortPy extensions, which are the repositories developed using the PortPy as a platform. 
To maintain the lightweight nature and user-friendliness of PortPy modules, our aim is to include only fundamental 
functionalities, along with benchmark data and algorithms in the PortPy repo, and establish separate repositories 
for other projects, similar to what we've done for projects like [LowDimRT](https://github.com/PortPy-Project/LowDimRT)
and [ECHO VMAT](https://github.com/PortPy-Project/ECHO-VMAT).

If you're interested in contributing to existing PortPy modules or wish to create a new module, 
we encourage you to contact us first. This will help ensure that our objectives and priorities are aligned. 
If you use PortPy to build your own package, you're welcome to host your package within the
[PortPy-Project orgainization](https://github.com/PortPy-Project). 
Alternatively, you can host your package on your own GitHub page. In this case, 
please inform us so that we can fork it and feature it under the PortPy-Project organization. 
For those keen on creating a logo for their repository, we offer the option to customize our [pre-designed logo](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFxivHC0Js/YqZREdr26pmEsIgCeuU-iA/view?utm_content=DAFxivHC0Js&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink&mode=preview).


# Data <a name="Data"></a>
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/PortPy Data.png" width="90%" height="40%">
<p>
PortPy equips researchers with a robust benchmark patient dataset, sourced from the FDA-approved Eclipse commercial treatment planning system through its API. This dataset embodies all necessary elements for optimizing various machine configurations such as beam angles, aperture shapes, and leaf movements. It includes

1. **Dose Influence Matrix (AKA dose deposition matrix, dij matrix):** The dose contribution of each beamlet to each voxel,
2. **Beamlets/Voxels Details:** Detailed information about the position and size of beamlets/voxels,
3. **Expert-Selected Benchmark Beams:** An expert clinical physicist has carefully selected benchmark beams, providing reference beams for comparison and benchmarking,
4. **Benchmark IMRT Plan:** A benchmark IMRT plan generated using our in-house automated treatment planning system called ECHO ([YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/895M6j5KjPs), [Paper](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/mp.13572)). This plan serves as a benchmark for evaluating new treatment planning algorithms.
5. **Benchmark Clinical Criteria:** A set of clinically relevant mean/max/DVH criteria for plan evaluation. 
Currently, this set encompasses only the Lung 2Gy×30 protocol but will be expanded in the future to more protocols as well as TCP/NTCP evaluation functions.  

To access these resources, users are advised to download the latest version of the dataset, 
which can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nA1oHEhlmh2Hk8an9e0Oi0ye6LRPREit?usp=sharing). 
Subsequently, create a directory titled './data' in the current project directory and transfer the downloaded 
file into it. For example, ./data/Lung_Phantom_Patient_1. 
We have adopted the widely-used JSON and HDF5 formats for data storage.
[HDFViwer](https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdfview/) can be utilized to view the contents of the HDF5 files.  



**Note:** Initially, we will utilize a lung dataset from [TCIA](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/NSCLC-Radiomics). The original DICOM CT images and structure sets are not included in the PortPy dataset and need to be directly downloaded from the TCIA. Users can fetch the **TCIA collection ID** and the **TCIA subject ID** for each PortPy patient using the *get_tcia_metadata()* method in PortPy and subsequently download the data from TCIA (see [imrt_tps_import](https://github.com/PortPy-Project/PortPy/blob/master/examples/imrt_tps_import.ipynb))
